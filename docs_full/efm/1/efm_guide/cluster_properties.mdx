title: The Cluster Properties File
metaTitle: The Cluster Properties File
metaDescription: description
---

Each node in a Failover Manager cluster has a properties file (by
default, named `efm.properties`) that contains the properties of the
individual node on which it resides. The Failover Manager installer
creates a file template for the properties file named
`efm.properties.in` in the `/etc/edb/efm-3.9` directory.

After completing the Failover Manager installation, you must make a
working copy of the template before modifying the file contents:

> `# cp /etc/edb/efm-3.9/efm.properties.in
> /etc/edb/efm-3.9/efm.properties`

After copying the template file, change the owner of the file to `efm`:

> `# chown efm:efm efm.properties`

Please note: By default, Failover Manager expects the cluster properties
file to be named `efm.properties`. If you name the properties file
something other than `efm.properties`, you must modify the service
script or unit file to instruct Failover Manager to use a different
name.

After creating the cluster properties file, add (or modify)
configuration parameter values as required. For detailed information
about each property, see [Specifying Cluster
Properties](specifying_cluster_properties).

The property files are owned by `root`. The Failover Manager service
script expects to find the files in the `/etc/edb/efm-3.9 directory`. If
you move the property file to another location, you must create a
symbolic link that specifies the new location.

Please note that all user scripts referenced in the properties file will
be invoked as the Failover Manager user.

## Specifying Cluster Properties

You can use the properties listed in the cluster properties file to
specify connection properties and behaviors for your Failover Manager
cluster. Modifications to property settings will be applied when
Failover Manager starts. If you modify a property value you must restart
Failover Manager to apply the changes.

Property values are case-sensitive. Note that while Postgres uses quoted
strings in parameter values, Failover Manager does not allow quoted
strings in property values. For example, while you might specify an IP
address in a Postgres configuration parameter as:

> `listen_addresses='192.168.2.47'`

Failover Manager requires that the value *not* be enclosed in quotes:

> `bind.address=192.168.2.54:7800`

Use the properties in the `efm.properties` file to specify connection,
administrative, and operational details for Failover Manager.

<div class="index">

db.user db.password.encrypted db.port db.database

Use the following properties to specify connection details for the
Failover Manager cluster:

The Postgres `pg_is_in_recovery()` function is a boolean function that
reports the recovery state of a database. The function returns `true` if
the database is in recovery, or false if the database is not in
recovery. When an agent starts, it connects to the local database and
invokes the `pg_is_in_recovery()` function. If the server responds true,
the agent assumes the role of standby; if the server responds false, the
agent assumes the role of master. If there is no local database, the
agent will assume an idle state.

<div class="note">

If `is.witness` is `true`, Failover Manager will not check the recovery
state.

<div class="index">

local.period local.timeout local.timeout.final

</div>

The following properties specify properties that apply to the local
server:

  - The `local.period` property specifies how many seconds between
    attempts to contact the database server.
  - The `local.timeout property` specifies how long an agent will wait
    for a positive response from the local database server.
  - The `local.timeout.final` property specifies how long an agent will
    wait after the final attempt to contact the database server on the
    current node. If a response is not received from the database within
    the number of seconds specified by the local.timeout.final property,
    the database is assumed to have failed.

For example, given the default values of these properties, a check of
the local database happens once every 10 seconds. If an attempt to
contact the local database does not come back positive within 60
seconds, Failover Manager makes a final attempt to contact the database.
If a response is not received within 10 seconds, Failover Manager
declares database failure and notifies the administrator listed in the
user.email property. These properties are not required on a dedicated
witness node.

master.shutdown.as.failure=false
```

The `master.shutdown.as.failure` property is meant to catch user error,
rather than failures such as the accidental shutdown of a master node.
The proper shutdown of a node can appear to the rest of the cluster like
a user has stopped the master Failover Manager agent (for example to
perform maintenance on the master database). If you set the
`master.shutdown.as.failure` property to `true`, care must be taken when
performing maintenance.

To perform maintenance on the master database when
`master.shutdown.as.failure` is `true`, you should stop the master agent
and wait to receive a notification that the master agent has failed but
the database is still running. Then it is safe to stop the master
database. Alternatively, you can use the `efm stop-cluster` command to
stop all of the agents without failure checks being performed.

If the same amount of data has been written to more than one standby
node, and a failover occurs, the use.replay.tiebreaker value will
determine how Failover Manager selects a replacement master. Set the
`use.replay.tiebreaker` property to `true` to instruct Failover Manager
to failover to the node that will come out of recovery faster, as
determined by the log sequence number. To ignore the log sequence number
and promote a node based on user preference, set `use.replay.tiebreaker`
to `false`.

**Please note:** You should set the `application.name` property on the
master and any promotable standby; in the event of a
failover/switchover, the master node could potentially become a standby
node again.

Use the `restore.command` property to instruct Failover Manager to
update the `restore_command` when a new master is promoted. `%h`
represents the address of the new master; Failover Manager will replace
`%h` with the address of the new master. `%f` and `%p` are placeholders
used by the server. If the property is left blank, Failover Manager will
not update the `restore_command` values on the standbys after a
promotion.

The synchronous_standby_names parameter on the master node specifies
the names and count of the synchronous standby servers that will confirm
receipt of data, to ensure that the master nodes can accept write
transactions. When set to true, Failover Manager will reduce the number
of synchronous standby servers and reload the configuration of the
master node to reflect the current value.

Failover Manager provides support for clusters that use a virtual IP. If
your cluster uses a virtual IP, provide the host name or IP address in
the `virtual.ip` property; specify the corresponding prefix in the
`virtual.ip.prefix` property. If `virtual.ip` is left blank, virtual IP
support is disabled.

Use the `virtual.ip.interface` property to provide the network interface
used by the VIP.

The specified virtual IP address is assigned only to the master node of
the cluster. If you specify `virtual.ip.single=true`, the same VIP
address will be used on the new master in the event of a failover.
Specify a value of false to provide a unique IP address for each node of
the cluster.

For information about using a virtual IP address, see `Using Failover
Manager with Virtual IP Addresses <using_vip_addresses>`.

Please Note: If a master agent is started and the node does not
currently have the VIP, the EFM agent will acquire it. Stopping a master
agent does not drop the VIP from the node.

Set the `check.vip.before.promotion` property to false to indicate that
Failover Manager will not check to see if a VIP is in use before
assigning it to a a new master in the event of a failure. Please note
that this could result in multiple nodes broadcasting on the same VIP
address; unless the master node is isolated or can be shut down via
another process, you should set this property to true.

Use the following properties to provide paths to scripts that
reconfigure your load balancer in the event of a switchover or master
failure scenario. The scripts will also be invoked in the event of a
standby failure. If you are using these properties, they should be
provided on every node of the cluster (master, standby, and witness) to
ensure that if a database node fails, another node will call the detach
script with the failed node's address.

Provide a script name after the `script.load.balancer.attach` property
to identify a script that will be invoked when a node should be attached
to the load balancer. Use the `script.load.balancer.detach` property to
specify the name of a script that will be invoked when a node should be
detached from the load balancer. Include the `%h` placeholder to
represent the IP address of the node that is being attached or removed
from the cluster. Include the `%t` placeholder to instruct Failover
Manager to include an m (for a master node) or an s (for a standby node)
in the string.
