  - EDB designs, establishes coding best practices, reviews, and
    verifies input validation for the logon UI for EDB Postgres
    Enterprise Manager where present. EDB follows the same approach for
    additional input components, however the nature of the product may
    require that it accepts freeform SQL, WMI or other strings to be
    entered and submitted by trusted users for which limited validation
    is possible. In such cases it is not possible to prevent users from
    entering incorrect or otherwise dangerous inputs.
  - EDB reserves the right to add features to products that accept
    freeform SQL, WMI or other potentially dangerous inputs from
    authenticated, trusted users in the future, but will ensure all such
    features are designed and tested to ensure they provide the minimum
    possible risk, and where possible, require superuser or equivalent
    privileges.
  - EDB does not that warrant that we can or will anticipate all
    potential threats and therefore our process cannot fully guarantee
    that all potential vulnerabilities have been addressed or
    considered.
