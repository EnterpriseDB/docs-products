+`Managing Configuration Settings`:index:
+***************************
+
+There are multiple configuration files that are read at startup by Postgres
+Enterprise Manager. These are as follows:
+
+* ``config.py``: This is the main configuration file, and should not be modified.
+  It can be used as a reference for configuration settings, that may be overridden
+  in one of the following files.
+
+* ``config_distro.py``: This file is read after ``config.py`` and is intended for
+  packagers to change any settings that are required for their Postgres
+  Enterprise Manager distribution. This may typically include certain paths and
+  file locations. This file is optional, and may be created by packagers in the
+  same directory as ``config.py`` if needed.
+
+* ``config_local.py``: This file is read after ``config_distro.py`` and is intended
+  for end users to change any default or packaging specific settings that they may
+  wish to adjust to meet local preferences or standards.This file is optional,
+  and may be created by users in the same directory as ``config.py`` if
+  needed.
+
+
+The default ``config.py`` file is shown below for reference:
+
+.. literalinclude:: ../../web/config.py
+   :language: python
