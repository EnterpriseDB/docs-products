When an update becomes available for a package installed on your
cluster, the console will display an alert symbol in the `UP` column of
the `Details` panel for the cluster, and in the `UP` column of the
`Address` table adjacent to the node that requires an update.

The columns display:

>   - A green checkmark indicates when an object is healthy.
>   - A yellow alert symbol calls attention to an object that requires
>     attention.
>   - A red error symbol signifies that an object is not available.
>   - A busy-indicator signals that the cluster is processing a request.
>   - A question mark indicates that the state of the resource is
>     unknown.

The overall cluster status (displayed in the top section of the Clusters
tab) is based on the values of the nodes within the cluster.

  - If all of the nodes within the cluster are up-to-date, the UP column
    displays a green checkmark.
  - If one or more nodes require a non-critical update, the UP column
    displays a yellow alert symbol.
  - If one or more nodes require a critical update, the UP column for
    the cluster displays a red error symbol.
  - If one or more nodes have an unknown package status, the UP column
    for the cluster displays a grey checkmark.

Use the `Upgrade` icon (located on the `Clusters` tab) to access a
dialog that allows you to update the server version on each node within
the cluster.

When the `Upgrade Cluster` dialog opens, select the radio button next to
an option to:

  - Select `OS and DB Minor Version Upgrade` to invoke a yum update
    command and update any outdated packages and perform a minor
    database version upgrade on each node of the cluster. For more
    information, see [Performing a Minor Version
    Upgrade](#performing-a-minor-version-upgrade).
  - Select `DB Major Version Upgrade` to select a version and perform a
    major version upgrade of the server. Please note that this
    functionality is restricted to users that are not required to use a
    template when deploying a cluster. For more information, see
    [Performing a Major Version
    Upgrade](#performing-a-major-version-upgrade).

After making a selection, click `Upgrade` to continue.

## Performing a Minor Version Upgrade

If you select the radio button next to `OS and DB Minor Version Upgrade`
and click the `Upgrade` button, the console will invoke the yum update
command on each node of the cluster. The yum update command will update
all installed packages to the most recent version available of the same
release (i.e., if you are running a 9.6 database server, yum will update
your database server to the most recent version of 9.6).

Before performing the update, CDS will perform a backup. During the
upgrade process, all clients will be disconnected from the server. The
updated server will retain the IP address used by the original server.
When the update has completed, clients may once again connect.

After performing a yum update, the node will be rebooted, initiating any
kernel updates required. When the update completes, CDS will send an
email notification that contains a list of the updated packages.

If one or more nodes in your cluster are currently displaying an unknown
status, CDS will display an error message; you must correct the problem
that is causing the unknown status before CDS can perform an update.

Please note that if the yum update command fails during the upgrade
process, CDS will terminate the process and yum update will not be run
on any remaining nodes, leaving the cluster partially upgraded.

## Performing a Major Version Upgrade

You can use the `Upgrade Cluster` dialog to upgrade your Postgres
database server; the upgrade must be to a more recent version of the
same server type and must use the same server image as the current
database engine. For example, you may upgrade an Advanced Server version
9.6 database server that resides on a CentOS 6.x host to Advanced Server
11, but you cannot move the server onto a CentOS 7.x host. Similarly,
you may not upgrade a PostgreSQL 9.6 database server that resides on a
CentOS 7.x host to use an Advanced Server 11 server on a CentOS 7.x
host. The server type and host operating system version must remain the
same.

Please note: if over half of the data space allocated to a cluster is
used, you must add storage to the cluster before performing the upgrade.

To upgrade a running cluster, select the radio button next to `DB Major
Version Upgrade` and then use the drop-down listbox to select a server
version. Click `Upgrade` to continue.

A popup will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to upgrade the
server; click the `Upgrade` button to perform an upgrade. The server
will be briefly unavailable during the upgrade process. The upgrade does
not change the IP address and listening port of the server.
