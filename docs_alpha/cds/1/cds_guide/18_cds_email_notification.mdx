title: "The CDS Email Notification System"
---

CDS invokes an email notification system that will alert you if your cluster changes or encounters a problem. Email notifications are sent to the address used to log in to the management console.

CDS will send an email:

  - When a new cluster is created.
  - If a server stops (or is terminated).
  - When a replica is added to a cluster.
  - When memory is scaled up.
  - When failover is invoked on a master or a replica.
  - If a backup fails.
  - If the password associated with your user account changes.
