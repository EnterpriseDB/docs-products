Upgrading PEM server installed with graphical installer

</div>

## Upgrading a PEM Server that was Installed with a Graphical Installer

Prerequisites:

If you are using a version of Postgres or Advanced Server that is lower
than version 10, then before the upgrade you need to install the libs
package of version 10 or above on the system where PEM server is
Installed. Use the following commands to install the libs version 10 or
above:

  -   - For Advanced Server:  
        `yum install edb-as<version>-server-libs`

  -   - For Postgres:  
        `yum install postgresql<version>-libs`

Where, *version* is the Postgres or Advanced Server version whose libs
package you want to install.

The default installation location for the PEM server when installed by
the graphical installer is `/opt/edb/pem`. In the example that follows,
substitute your server installation location for
`<PEM_installation_path>`.

1.  Logout from PEM.

2.  Stop the PEMHTTPD service on PEM server. In case PEM server and web
    server are on two different systems, run the command on the web
    server:
    
    `systemctl stop PEMHTTPD`

3.  Install the `epel-release` package by running any one of the
    following commands:

<!-- end list -->

  - `yum -y install
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`
  - `yum install epel-release`

> 
> </div>
> 
> You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the
> `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).
> 
> </div>

4.  You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB
    repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:
    
    > <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

5.  After receiving your repository credentials you can:
    
    1.  Create the repository configuration file.
    2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.

> **Creating a Repository Configuration File**
> 
> To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser
> privileges, and invoke the following command:
> 
> > `yum -y install
> > https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`
> 
> The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file
> resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.
> 
> **Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**
> 
> After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to
> ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the
> `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification
> with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.
> 
> ``` text
> [edb]
> name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
> baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=1
> gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
> ```

6.  Use the `yum makecache` command to download the metadata for the
    currently enabled repositories; when the command completes, check
    the available packages to confirm that the list includes the latest
    PEM server:
    
    `yum makecache`

> `yum list edb-pem`

7.  Install the PEM server RPM on PEM server. In case PEM server and web
    server are on two different systems, run the command on PEM server
    as well as web server. When the installation completes, use the `yum
    info` command to confirm the installation details:
    
    `yum install edb-pem`
    
    `yum info edb-pem`

8.  After installation, copy the `agent.cfg` file from the current
    location (the location required by the graphical installer) to the
    location required by the RPM package:
    
    `cp /<PEM_installation_path>/agent/etc/agent.cfg
    /usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg`

9.  Open the agent configuration file located at:
    
    `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg`
    
    Then, set the value of the `ca_file` parameter:
    
    `ca_file=/usr/libexec/libcurl-pem/share/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

10. Copy the `pem.db` file (and other required files) to the RPM
    installation location and change the file ownership. In case PEM
    server and web server are on two different systems, run the below
    commands on the web server:

> `cp -r /<PEM_installation_path>/server/share/pemhome/.pem/*
> /var/lib/pemhome/.pem/`
> 
> `chown -R pem:pem /var/lib/pemhome/.pem/`

11. Change the home directory in the `passwd` file from the location
    identified by the graphical installer to the RPM location. In case
    PEM server and web server are on two different systems, run the
    commands on PEM server as well as web server:

> `usermod -m -d /var/lib/pemhome pem`
> 
> `cat /etc/passwd | grep pem`

12. Take a backup of the PEM service file and agent certificates:

> `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service
> /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service_bkp`
> 
> `mv /root/.pem/agent1.key /root/.pem/agent1.key.bkp`
> 
> `mv /root/.pem/agent1.crt /root/.pem/agent1.crt.bkp`

13. Uninstall the PEM server using the graphical uninstaller from PEM
    server and web server machines:

> `/<PEM_installation_path> /server/uninstall-pemserver`

14. Execute the PEM RPM configuration script on PEM server and web
    server; when prompted, provide the backing database details: the
    script should run without generating errors:

> `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh`

15. Restore the service file backup and agent certificates to original
    location on PEM server.

> `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service_bkp
> /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service`
> 
> `mv /root/.pem/agent1.crt.bkp /root/.pem/agent1.crt`
> 
> `mv /root/.pem/agent1.key.bkp /root/.pem/agent1.key`

16. Enable the `pemagent` service on PEM server and web server. Start
    the `pemagent` and `httpd` services on the web server.

> `systemctl enable pemagent`
> 
> `systemctl start pemagent`
> 
> `systemctl start httpd`

17. Launch the PEM web interface. Check the server and agent to confirm
    the PEM version, server status, and schema version. At this point,
    everything should be up and running. You can now uninstall PEMHTTD
    service from web server as it is no longer in use.

Upgrading PEM agent installed with graphical installer

</div>

## Upgrading a PEM agent that was Installed with a Graphical Installer

The default installation location for the PEM server when installed by
the graphical installer is `/opt/edb/pem`. In the example that follows,
substitute your server installation location for
`<PEM_installation_path>`.

1.  Use the version specific command to stop the `pemagent` service.

>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 7.x host:
> 
> > `systemctl stop pemagent`
> 
>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 6.x host:
> 
> > `/etc/init.d/pemagent stop (RHEL -6)`

2.  Install the supporting `epel` packages:
    
    `yum install epel-release`

3.  Install the EDB repository configuration file:
    
    `yum install
    http://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

4\. When the repository configuration file installation completes,
modify the `dependencies` and `tools` repository definitions, ensuring
that the repository definitions are enabled and providing the correct
repository credentials. The location of the file is:

> `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo`

5\. The `yum makecache` command downloads the metadata for the currently
enabled repositories; when the command completes, check the available
packages to confirm that the list includes the latest PEM agent:

> `yum makecache`
> 
> `yum list edb-pem-agent`

6.  Install the PEM agent RPM; when the installation completes, you can
    use the `yum info` command to confirm installation information for
    the PEM agent:
    
    `yum install edb-pem-agent`
    
    `yum info edb-pem-agent`

7\. After installation, copy the PEM agent configuration file
(`agent.cfg`) from the previous location to the location required by the
RPM installer:

> `cp /PEM_installation_path/agent/etc/agent.cfg
> /usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg`

8.  Open the agent configuration file located at:
    
    `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg`
    
    Then, set the value of the `ca_file` parameter:
    
    `ca_file=/usr/libexec/libcurl-pem/share/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

9.  Take a backup of the service file and agent certificates:

<!-- end list -->

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7.x, use the following command to back up the
    service file:
    
    > `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service
    > /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service_bkp`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 6.x, use the following command to back up the
    service file:
    
    > `cp /etc/init.d/pemagent_bkp /etc/init.d/pemagent`
    > 
    > Then, copy the agent certificates; in the following commands,
    > `<agent_id>` should specify the agent identifier (for example,
    > agent2 or agent3):
    > 
    > `mv /root/.pem/<agent_id>.key /root/.pem/<agent_id>.key.bkp`
    > 
    > `mv /root/.pem/<agent_id>.crt /root/.pem/<agent_id>.crt.bkp`

<!-- end list -->

10. Uninstall the PEM agent using bitrock uninstaller:

> `/PEM_installation_path/agent/uninstall-pemagent`

11. Use version specific commands to restore the service file backup and
    agent certificates to original location. For example:

>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 7.x host:
> 
> > `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service_bkp
> > /usr/lib/systemd/system/pemagent.service`
> 
>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 6.x host:
> 
> > `cp /etc/init.d/pemagent /etc/init.d/pemagent_bkp`
> > 
> > Then, move the agent certificate files; in the following commands,
> > `<agent_id>` should specify the agent identifier (for example,
> > agent2 or agent3):
> > 
> > `mv /root/.pem/<agent_id>.key.bkp /root/.pem/<agent_id>.key`
> > 
> > `mv /root/.pem/<agent_id>.crt.bkp /root/.pem/<agent_id>.crt`

12. Enable the pemagent service, and start `pemagent` and `httpd`.

>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 7.x host, use the commands:
> 
> > `systemctl enable pemagent`
> > 
> > `systemctl start pemagent`
> 
>   - On a RHEL or CentOS 6.x host:
> 
> > `/etc/init.d/pemagent start`

At this point, the PEM agent should be up and running; you can use the
PEM web interface to check the agent version and status.

## Upgrading SQL Profiler on a Linux host

To upgrade a SQL Profiler installation on a Linux host:

1.  Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking
    the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.
    
    By default, if you are using Advanced Server on a Linux host that
    was installed with a graphical installer, the script resides in the
    `share/contrib` directory under the Advanced Server installation.
    
    If you are using a PostgreSQL installation on a Linux host, the
    script resides in the `share/postgresql/contrib` directory under the
    PostgreSQL installation.

2.  Then, use the following command on each node you wish to profile:
    `yum install
    postgresql-<sql_version>-sqlprofiler-<sqlprofiler_version>`

Where, *sql_version* is the version of the postgres and
\<sqlprofiler_version\> is the SQL Profiler version.

> After updating the PEM components, you are ready to update the backing
> database.
