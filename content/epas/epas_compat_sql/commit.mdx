**Name**

`COMMIT --` commit the current transaction

**Synopsis**

``` text
COMMIT [ WORK ]
```

**Description**

`COMMIT` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the
transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if
a crash occurs.

**Parameters**

`WORK`

Optional key word - has no effect.

**Notes**

Use `ROLLBACK` to abort a transaction. Issuing `COMMIT` when not inside
a transaction does no harm.

Please note: Executing a `COMMIT` in a plpgsql procedure will throw an
error if there is an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

**Examples**

To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

``` text
COMMIT;
```
