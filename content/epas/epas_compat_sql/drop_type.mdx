**Name**

`DROP TYPE --` remove a type definition

**Synopsis**

``` text
DROP TYPE [ BODY ] name
```

**Description**

`DROP TYPE` removes the type definition. To execute this command you
must be a superuser or the owner of the type.

The optional `BODY` qualifier applies only to object type definitions,
not to collection types nor to composite types. If `BODY` is specified,
only the object type body is removed â€“ the object type specification is
not dropped. If `BODY` is omitted, both the object type specification
and body are removed.

The type will not be deleted if there are other database objects
dependent upon the named type.

**Parameters**

`name`

> The name of a type definition to remove.

**Examples**

Drop the object type named `addr_obj_typ`:

``` text
DROP TYPE addr_obj_typ;
```

Drop the nested table type named `budget_tbl_typ`:

``` text
DROP TYPE budget_tbl_typ;
```
