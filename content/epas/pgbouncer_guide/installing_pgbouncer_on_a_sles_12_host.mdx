You can use the zypper package manager to install PgBouncer on an SLES
12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it
installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that
are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

Before installing PgBouncer, add the EnterpriseDB repository to your
SLES host. Use the command:

> `zypper addrepo http://yum.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo`

The command creates the `edbas96suse.repo` file in the
`/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. The file contains:

``` text
[edbas96suse]
name=EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 $releasever - $basearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=0
baseurl=http://username:password@yum.enterprisedb.com/9.6/suse/suse-$releasever-$basearch
type=rpm-md
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://yum.enterprisedb.com/9.6/suse/suse-$releasever-$basearch/repodata/repomd.xml.key
```

Use your choice of editor to modify the file, replacing the `username`
and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with your
EnterpriseDB user name and repository password.

Then, use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES
host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

> `zypper refresh`

[r/t/a/? shows all options] (r):
```

When prompted, specify `a` to `always trust` the provided key, and
update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

Before installing PgBouncer, you must add SUSEConnect and the SUSE
Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE,
allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

> `zypper install SUSEConnect`
> 
> `SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64`

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install PgBouncer:

> `zypper install edb-pgbouncer17`
