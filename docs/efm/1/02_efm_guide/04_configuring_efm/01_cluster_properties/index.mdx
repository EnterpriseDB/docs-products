title: "The Cluster Properties File"
---

<div id="cluster_properties" class="registered_link"></div>


Each node in a Failover Manager cluster has a properties file (by default, named `efm.properties`) that contains the properties of the individual node on which it resides. The Failover Manager installer creates a file template for the properties file named `efm.properties.in` in the `/etc/edb/efm-3.9` directory.

After completing the Failover Manager installation, you must make a working copy of the template before modifying the file contents:

> `# cp /etc/edb/efm-3.9/efm.properties.in /etc/edb/efm-3.9/efm.properties`

After copying the template file, change the owner of the file to `efm`:

> `# chown efm:efm efm.properties`

Please note: By default, Failover Manager expects the cluster properties file to be named `efm.properties`. If you name the properties file something other than `efm.properties`, you must modify the service script or unit file to instruct Failover Manager to use a different name.

After creating the cluster properties file, add (or modify) configuration parameter values as required. For detailed information about each property, see [Specifying Cluster Properties ](../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/index#specifying_cluster_properties).

The property files are owned by `root`. The Failover Manager service script expects to find the files in the `/etc/edb/efm-3.9 directory`. If you move the property file to another location, you must create a symbolic link that specifies the new location.

Please note that all user scripts referenced in the properties file will be invoked as the Failover Manager user.

<div id="specifying_cluster_properties" class="registered_link"></div>

## Specifying Cluster Properties

You can use the properties listed in the cluster properties file to specify connection properties and behaviors for your Failover Manager cluster. Modifications to property settings will be applied when Failover Manager starts. If you modify a property value you must restart Failover Manager to apply the changes.

Property values are case-sensitive. Note that while Postgres uses quoted strings in parameter values, Failover Manager does not allow quoted strings in property values. For example, while you might specify an IP address in a Postgres configuration parameter as:

> `listen_addresses='192.168.2.47'`

Failover Manager requires that the value *not* be enclosed in quotes:

> `bind.address=192.168.2.54:7800`

Use the properties in the `efm.properties` file to specify connection, administrative, and operational details for Failover Manager.

<div class="index">

Use the following properties to specify connection details for the Failover Manager cluster:

The Postgres `pg_is_in_recovery()` function is a boolean function that reports the recovery state of a database. The function returns `true` if the database is in recovery, or false if the database is not in recovery. When an agent starts, it connects to the local database and invokes the `pg_is_in_recovery()` function. If the server responds true, the agent assumes the role of standby; if the server responds false, the agent assumes the role of master. If there is no local database, the agent will assume an idle state.

If `is.witness` is `true`, Failover Manager will not check the recovery state.

<div class="index">

local.period local.timeout local.timeout.final

</div>

The following properties specify properties that apply to the local server:

  - The `local.period` property specifies how many seconds between attempts to contact the database server.
  - The `local.timeout property` specifies how long an agent will wait for a positive response from the local database server.
  - The `local.timeout.final` property specifies how long an agent will wait after the final attempt to contact the database server on the current node. If a response is not received from the database within the number of seconds specified by the local.timeout.final property, the database is assumed to have failed.

For example, given the default values of these properties, a check of the local database happens once every 10 seconds. If an attempt to contact the local database does not come back positive within 60 seconds, Failover Manager makes a final attempt to contact the database. If a response is not received within 10 seconds, Failover Manager declares database failure and notifies the administrator listed in the user.email property. These properties are not required on a dedicated witness node.

master.shutdown.as.failure=false
```

The `master.shutdown.as.failure` property is meant to catch user error, rather than failures such as the accidental shutdown of a master node. The proper shutdown of a node can appear to the rest of the cluster like a user has stopped the master Failover Manager agent (for example to perform maintenance on the master database). If you set the `master.shutdown.as.failure` property to `true`, care must be taken when performing maintenance.

To perform maintenance on the master database when `master.shutdown.as.failure` is `true`, you should stop the master agent and wait to receive a notification that the master agent has failed but the database is still running. Then it is safe to stop the master database. Alternatively, you can use the `efm stop-cluster` command to stop all of the agents without failure checks being performed.

Use the following properties to provide paths to scripts that reconfigure your load balancer in the event of a switchover or master failure scenario. The scripts will also be invoked in the event of a standby failure. If you are using these properties, they should be provided on every node of the cluster (master, standby, and witness) to ensure that if a database node fails, another node will call the detach script with the failed node's address.

Provide a script name after the `script.load.balancer.attach` property to identify a script that will be invoked when a node should be attached to the load balancer. Use the `script.load.balancer.detach` property to specify the name of a script that will be invoked when a node should be detached from the load balancer. Include the `%h` placeholder to represent the IP address of the node that is being attached or removed from the cluster. Include the `%t` placeholder to instruct Failover Manager to include an m (for a master node) or an s (for a standby node) in the string.
