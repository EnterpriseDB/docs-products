The pgpool-II utility package acts as a middleman between client applications and a Postgres database server. pgpool-II functionality is transparent to client applications; client applications connect to pgpool-II instead of directly to Advanced Server, which then assigns one of its pooled sessions to the client. When the client closes its application session, pgpool puts its session back into the pool, ready to be reused.

EnterpriseDB supports the following pgpool-II functionality:

  - Load balancing
  - Connection pooling
  - High availability
  - Connection limits
