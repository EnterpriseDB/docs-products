When a CDS user selects an AWS region on the CDS management `Dashboard` tab, CDS spins up an end-user console in a new browser tab. You can use tabs on the end-user console to create, manage, and monitor your Postgres instances and backups:

  - Use the [Clusters tab](09_cds_user_cluster_tab#cds_user_cluster_tab) to create, monitor and manage Postgres instances.
  - Use links on the [Backups tab](10_cds_user_backup_tab#cds_user_backup_tab) to restore or delete backups as needed.
