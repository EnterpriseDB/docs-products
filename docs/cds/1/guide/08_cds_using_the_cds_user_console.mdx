When a CDS user selects an AWS region on the CDS management `Dashboard`
tab, CDS spins up an end-user console in a new browser tab. You can use
tabs on the end-user console to create, manage, and monitor your
Postgres instances and backups:

\- Use the [Clusters tab](cds_user_cluster_tab) to create, monitor and
manage

> Postgres instances.

\- Use links on the [Backups tab](cds_user_backup_tab) to restore or
delete

> backups as needed.
