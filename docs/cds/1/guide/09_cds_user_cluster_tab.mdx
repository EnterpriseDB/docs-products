cluster health

</div>

Indicators in the columns to the right of a cluster name display the
current health of the cluster. Click on a column name to sort the
contents of the column; click a second time to reverse the sort-order.

  - The `VM` column displays the state of the virtual machine on which
    the cluster resides.
  - The `HA` column displays the state of the high-availability cluster.
  - The `DB` column displays the state of the database server.
  - The `UP` column displays the current status of the packages
    installed on the cluster. Periodically, the cluster manager performs
    a check to see if the packages are up to date.

Status indicators provide quick visual feedback about each feature:

download log files log files

</div>

To download an archive of log files, right-click on a node name and
select:

  - `Download DB Logs` to download database server logs.
  - `Download pgPool Logs` to download pgPool (load balancing) logs.

![*Downloading log files.*](images/cds_user_cluster_download_logs.png)

The menu options are context sensitive, displaying log types only for
software that is deployed on the selected node. The archive name is in
the following form:

> `<address>-<log_type>-<date>.tar.gz`

Where:

> *address* is the address of the selected node.
> 
> *log_type* is the type of log file (server type or pgPool).
> 
> *date* is the date that the archive was generated.

Archive preparation can take some time if your log files are large; the
download will begin when the preparation completes.

By default, the box next to `Release elastic IP address` is checked.
Deselect this option if you wish to retain the IP address for re-use
with other clusters. If you release the IP address, it will be made
available for use by other clusters.

When you terminate an active cluster, backups are not deleted. Backups
(including user data) are retained until they are selected and deleted
from the `Backups` tab.

The panels located at the bottom of the `Clusters` tab provide easy
access to helpful statistical usage and activity information about the
currently selected cluster. Three navigation bars control the display;
click a bar to access one of the following panels:

  - Open the `Details` panel to view information about the selected
    cluster.
  - Open the `Monitoring` panel to view usage statistics for the
    selected cluster.
  - Open the `Events` panel to review event logs describing activities
    on the selected cluster.

<div class="index">

The Details Panel

</div>

## The Details Panel

Click the `Details` navigation bar to open the `Details` panel.

![*The Details panel on the Clusters tab.*](images/cds_details_tab.png)

The left pane of the `Details` panel displays information about the
currently selected cluster:

  - The name of the cluster
  - The date and time that the cluster was created
  - The name of the database superuser
  - The name of the cluster owner
  - The email address to which notifications about the cluster will be
    sent
  - The cluster size
  - If the cluster is encrypted
  - If applicable, the IOPS value for the cluster
  - The region in which the cluster resides
  - The virtual network or VPC ID in which the cluster resides
  - The cluster's hardware type or Server Class
  - The engine type and version that resides on the server
  - If a template was used when provisioning the cluster, the template
    name
  - If the cluster is configured to update when provisioned

You can use controls on the `Details` panel to specify:

  - Failover preferences for the cluster
  - Auto-scaling thresholds for the cluster
  - Backup preferences for the cluster
  - If continuous archiving should be enabled for the cluster

Please note: If a template was used to specify the configuration details
for the cluster, the template may prohibit access to auto-scaling or
manual scaling functionality.

<div class="index">

cluster healing mode

</div>

**Selecting a Cluster Healing Mode**

Use the `Cluster healing mode` radio buttons to specify the type of
failover that should be employed:

  - Select the `Replace failed master with a new master` radio button to
    specify that the cluster manager should create a new master to
    replace a failed master node.
    
    When replacing a failed master node with a new master node, the data
    volumes from the failed instance are attached to the new master
    node, preserving data integrity, while the replicas continue serving
    client queries.

  - Select the `Replace failed master with existing replica` radio
    button to specify that the cluster manager should promote a replica
    node to be the new master node for the cluster.
    
    When replacing a failed master node with an existing replica, a
    replica node is marked for promotion to master node, while the other
    replica nodes are re-configured to replicate data from the new
    master node. Since replica nodes use asynchronous replication, any
    data that was committed to the old master node, but not pushed to
    the replica prior to the node failure will be lost.

Please note that replacing a failed master node with a new master node
can take a bit longer than promoting a replica node to the role of
master, but it does have the advantage of guaranteeing that no committed
data will be lost. If recovery time for your cluster is more important
than preserving any non-replicated transactions, then select Replace
failed master with existing replica as the healing mode.

<div class="index">

auto-scaling thresholds

</div>

**Adjusting Auto-Scaling Thresholds**

Use the `Auto-Scaling Thresholds` controls on the `Details` panel to
adjust the threshold at which CDS automatically scales up cluster
resources. When auto-scaling in enabled, CDS monitors the server storage
and connection resources in use, and automatically adds additional
resources when usage exceeds a user specified percent.

  - When the `% of Storage Size used` is reached, CDS will automatically
    increase your data space by 50%.
  - When the `# of Server Connections` is reached, CDS adds replica
    nodes.

Use the Auto Scale Options controls to adjust the threshold at which CDS
automatically scales up cluster resources. The Auto Scale Options
controls are located on the Details panel; to access the Details panel,
navigate to the Clusters tab, and highlight the name of a cluster.

![*Auto Scale Options
controls.*](images/cds_user_cluster_details_autoscale.png)

Adjust the `Auto Scale Options` sliders to increase or decrease the
thresholds at which automatic scaling is invoked. When you modify the
values, CDS will display a New Value Saved notice, alerting you that
your changes have been saved.

<div class="index">

backup settings

</div>

**Modifying Backup Settings**

Use the fields in the `Backup Settings` box to change your backup
preferences for the selected cluster:

  - Use the `Backup Window` drop-down listbox to select an optimal time
    to process cluster backups; specify a time when the number of
    clients accessing the database is minimal.

  - Use the `Backup Retention` field to specify the number of backups
    that should be stored for the selected cluster.

  - Select the checkbox next to `Continuous Archiving (Point-in-Time
    Recovery)` to enable point-in-time recovery for a cluster. When
    enabled, a base backup is automatically performed that can to be
    used to restore to a specific point in time. All subsequent
    automatic scheduled backups will also support point-in-time
    recovery. Note that if you deselect this option, the cluster (and
    subsequent automatic backups) will be re-configured to not include
    support for point-in-time recovery.
    
    When point-in-time recovery is enabled, the value specified in the
    Backup Retention field determines the duration of the point-in-time
    recovery backup window. For example, if you specify a value of 7,
    the backup window will be 7 calendar days long. When the backup
    retention threshold is reached, the oldest base backup is removed,
    as well as any WAL files required to perform a recovery with that
    backup.

<div class="index">

connection status cluster information

</div>

**Reviewing Cluster Connection and Status Information**

The right side of the Details panel contains a status overview and
connection information for the selected cluster. If you have created
replicas, the secondary server nodes are listed below the master node in
the tree control; expand the tree control to view the status of the
replication nodes.

Status indicators on the `Clusters` tab provide quick visual feedback
about the status of your cluster:

  - A green checkmark indicates that an object is healthy.
  - A yellow alert symbol calls attention to an object that requires
    attention.
  - A red error symbol signifies that an object is not available.
  - A question mark indicates that the state of the resource is unknown.

On the Details panel, use the settings icon in the upper-right corner of
the `` `UP `` column to open a tab that allows you to select the columns
that will be displayed in the panel.

![*The column selection
tab.*](images/cds_user_cluster_details_column_selection.png)

The columns display:

  - The `AZ` column displays the Availability Zone in which the cluster
    resides.
  - The `VPC ID` column displays the identifier of the VPC on which the
    cluster resides.
  - The `LBPORT` column displays the port number to which a client
    application should connect to utilize load balancing.
  - The `DBPORT` column displays the default listener port for the
    Advanced Server or PostgreSQL server.
  - The `CXN` column displays the current number of connections to the
    node.
  - The `VM` column displays the state of the virtual machine on which
    the cluster resides.
  - The `HA` column displays the state of the high-availability cluster.
  - The `DB` column displays the state of the database server.
  - The `UP` column displays the current status of the packages
    installed on the cluster. Periodically, the cluster manager performs
    a check to see if the packages are up to date. If an update becomes
    available, the UP column will display a yellow alert symbol (if the
    update is non-critical), or a red error symbol (if the update is a
    critical security alert).

<div class="index">

monitoring

</div>

## The Monitoring Panel

Click the `Monitoring` navigation bar to open the `Monitoring` panel.

The `Monitoring` panel displays graphs that allow you to review
statistical usage information about the amount of storage and the CPU
load for the selected cluster.

![*The Monitoring panel displays usage
information.*](images/cds_monitoring.png)

Use the `Time Range` drop-down listbox to modify the time period that
the charted information on the `Monitoring` panel spans.

The graphs on the `Monitoring` panel display resource usage information:

  - The `Data Space` chart displays the amount of allocated data space
    used by the selected cluster. The red line denotes the threshold
    specified by the Data Space Threshold slider on the Details panel
    (the threshold at which the cluster will be scaled-up). The blue
    line indicates the amount of the data space that is currently in
    use.
  - The `Connections` chart displays a graph of the number of
    connections to the cluster during the selected time range. The red
    line denotes the threshold specified by the Connections slider on
    the Details panel.
  - The `Load` chart displays the processing load placed on the CPU by
    connecting clients. The value displayed is the actual load average
    as read from the program, /proc/loadavg. The chart shows the number
    of jobs in the run queue or waiting for disk I/O, averaged over 15
    minute periods.
  - The `Replication Lag` chart displays the replication lag (in
    seconds) for the cluster. Each replica node is displayed as a
    separate colored line on the chart; the key at the bottom of the
    chart identifies the IP address of the node.

<div class="index">

events

</div>

## The Events Panel

Click the `Events` navigation bar to open the `Events` panel.

The `Events` panel displays an event log containing a history of
selected events for the connected user.

![*The Events panel displays server activity.*](images/cds_events.png)

Highlight a cluster name to display only events for that cluster; if you
do not select a cluster, the `Events` panel will display the collected
events for the connected user.

  - Click a column heading to sort the logged activity by the selected
    column; click again to reverse the sort order.
  - Use the mouse to select multiple rows from the event log for copy
    and paste operations.
