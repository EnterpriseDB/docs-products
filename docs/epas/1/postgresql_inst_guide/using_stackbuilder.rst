.. index:: Stack Builder

The Stack Builder utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies
the process of downloading and installing modules that complement your
PostgreSQL installation. When you install a module with Stack Builder,
Stack Builder automatically resolves any software dependencies.

Stack Builder requires Internet access; if your installation of
PostgreSQL resides behind a firewall (with restricted Internet access),
Stack Builder can download program installers through a proxy server.
The module provider determines if the module can be accessed through an
HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy; currently, all updates are transferred via
an HTTP proxy and the FTP proxy information is not used.

You can invoke Stack Builder at any time after the installation has
completed by selecting the ``Application Stack Builder`` menu option from
the ``PostgreSQL 12`` menu. Enter your system password (if prompted), and
the Stack Builder welcome window opens.

Use the drop-down listbox on the welcome window to select your
PostgreSQL installation.

If the selected PostgreSQL installation has restricted Internet access,
use the ``Proxy Servers`` button on the ``Welcome`` window to open the ``Proxy
servers`` dialog.

Enter the IP address and port number of the proxy server in the ``HTTP
proxy`` or ``FTP proxy`` fields on the ``Proxy servers`` dialog. Currently, all
Stack Builder modules are distributed via HTTP proxy (FTP proxy
information is ignored). Click ``OK`` to continue.

The tree control on the Stack Builder module selection window contains a node for each module category; click on a
category heading to expose the modules within that category.

Each entry within the tree control is the name of a module that can be
installed with Stack Builder.

-  If the module is installed, you will see the word (``installed``) to the
   right of the module name.

-  Boxes next to the modules that are already installed, but eligible
   for update are automatically checked.

-  To add new modules to the selected PostgreSQL installation, check the
   box to the left of the module name and click ``Next``.

The ``Selected packages`` window confirms the packages selected.

The package installers are downloaded to the directory specified in the
``Download directory`` field. Use the button to the right of the ``Download
directory`` field to open a file selector, and choose an alternate
location to store the downloaded installers.

Click ``Next`` to connect to the server and download the required
installation files. When the downloads complete, a window opens
confirming that the installation files have been downloaded and are
ready for installation.

You can check the box next to ``Skip Installation`` and select ``Next`` to exit
Stack Builder without installing the downloaded files, or leave the box
unchecked and click ``Next`` to start the installation process.

Each downloaded installer has different requirements. As the installers
execute, they may prompt you to confirm acceptance of license
agreements, to enter passwords, and enter configuration information.

During the installation process, you may be prompted by one (or more) of
the installers to restart your system. Select ``No`` or ``Restart Later`` until
all installations are completed. When the last installation has
completed, re-boot the system to apply all of the updates.

You may occasionally encounter packages that donâ€™t install successfully.
If a package fails to install, Stack Builder will alert you to the
installation error with a popup dialog, and write a message to the log
file at stored in ``%TEMP%``.

When the installation is complete, the installer will alert you to the
success or failure of the installations of the requested packages. If
you were prompted by an installer to restart your computer, re-boot now.

.. Note:: The modules supported by Stack Builder are subject to change and vary by platform.
