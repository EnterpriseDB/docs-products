Security over what user may execute an SPL program and what database objects an SPL program may access for any given user executing the program is controlled by the following:

  - Privilege to execute a program.
  - Privileges granted on the database objects (including other SPL programs) which a program attempts to access.
  - Whether the program is defined with definer’s rights or invoker’s rights.

These aspects are discussed in the following sections.
