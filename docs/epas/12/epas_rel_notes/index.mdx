With this Beta release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13.0, EnterpriseDB continues to lead as the only worldwide company to deliver innovative and low cost open-source-derived database solutions with commercial quality, ease of use, compatibility, scalability, and performance for small or large-scale enterprises.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13.0 Beta is built on open-source PostgreSQL 13.0 Beta-1, which introduces a myriad enhancements that enable databases to scale up and scale out in more efficient ways. PostgreSQL 13.0 is a level up on the existing partitioning functionality, has several improvements in the btree indexes for handling duplicate data, provides more ways to monitor activity within a PostgreSQL database, introduces incremental sorting, trusted extension, and a multitude of other new features and capabilities.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13.0 Beta adds a number of new stand-out features:

  - `Automatic LIST Partition`
  - `PARTITION` or `SUBPARTITION` number while creating `HASH` partition table
  - Forward declarations in the package body
  - `CREATE INDEX` syntax contains column name and constant
  - `USING INDEX` clause in `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE`
  - EDB*Loader: handle unique constraint violations
  - `STATS_MODE` aggregate function
  - Support for `utl_http.end_of_body` exception
  - EDB*Loader supports any connection parameters with the `-c` or `CONNSTR` option

These release notes are applicable to the EPAS 13.0.1 Beta released on May 29, 2020.

## PostgreSQL v13 Beta-1 Features

The major highlights of this release are:

  - Several enhancements related to duplication handling in btree index.
    
    > These enhancements help to shrink index size and improve lookup speed, particularly for indexes that contain repeated values.

  - Improvements in PostgreSQL's partitioning functionality.
    
    > Including an increased number of cases where a join directly between partitioned tables can occur, which can improve overall query execution time.
    > 
    > Partitioned tables now support `BEFORE` row-level triggers, and a partitioned table can now be fully replicated via logical replication without having to publish individual partitions.

  - One of the most anticipated features of PostgreSQL 13 is the ability for the `VACUUM` command to process indexes in parallel.
    
    > This functionality can be accessed using the new `PARALLEL` option on the `VACUUM` command (or `--parallel` on `vacuumdb`), which allows you to specify the number of parallel workers to use for vacuuming indexes, although this does not work with the `FULL` option.

  - The capability of incremental sorting which accelerates sorting data when data that is sorted from earlier parts of a query are already sorted.

  - `.datetime()` function for jsonpath queries, which will automatically convert a date-like or time-like string to the appropriate PostgreSQL date/time datatype.

  - PostgreSQL 13 introduces the channel_binding connection parameters, which lets a client specify that they want to require the channel binding functionality as part of SCRAM.

  - PostgreSQL 13 introduces the concept of a "trusted extension", which allows for a superuser to specify extensions that a user can install in their database so long as they have a `CREATE` privilege.

## EDB Postgres Advanced Server v13.0 Beta Features

The major highlights of this release are:

  - `Automatic List Partitioning`
    
    > Automatic List Partitioning is an extension to `LIST` partitioning that allows a database to automatically create a partition for any new distinct value of the list partitioning key. A new partition is created when data is inserted into the `LIST` partitioned table and the inserted value does not match any of the existing table partitions.

  - Additional `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, and `numeric` variants in aggregate function `MEDIAN`.

  - Added support for `CREATE INDEX` syntax that contains a column name and number i.e. `(col_name,1)`

  - Added support to alter the owner of the directory - `ALTER DIRECTORY <dir_name> OWNER TO <role_name>`

  - CSV and XML audit logs have been made consistent
    
    > It has been observed that there is a difference in terms of number of fields in the CSV and XML audit logs. Now the audit log is consistent across both versions.

  - Default behaviour for `dbms_output` made compatible with Redwood.

  - Log number of processed statements with `edb_log_every_bulk_value`
    
    > During bulk execution we can't identify the number of rows processed when `edb_log_every_bulk_value` is off. This feature allows us to log it both in the audit log file and server log file.

  - EDB*Loader duplicate row aborts
    
    > Previously, EDB* Loader would abort the whole operation if any record insertion fails due to a unique constraint violation. This is fixed by using speculative insertion to insert rows. This behavior is enforced if 'handle_conflicts' (a new parameter) is `true` and indexes are present.

  - `SYSDATE` now behaves in a more compatible manner
    
    > `SYSDATE` output changes at every nesting level, so multiple copies of `SYSDATE` in the same SQL query will return the same value each time. `SYSDATE` changes on successive statements in the same procedure, or within a nested function call.

  - `PARALLEL [n] | NOPARALLEL` option for `CREATE TABLE` and `INDEX`
    
    > Advanced Server now supports `PARALLEL [n] | NOPARALLEL` clause in the `CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER INDEX` to enable or disable parallelism on an index or a table.

  - `PARTITION` or `SUBPARTITION` number while creating a table
    
    > This feature allows you to create automatic hash partitions at a subpartition level.

  - EDB*Loader supports any connection parameters
    
    > You can use the EDB*Loader `-c` or `CONNSTR` options to specify any connection parameters supported by `libpq`. This includes SSL connection parameters.

  - `STATS_MODE` function
    
    > The `STATS_MODE` function takes a set of values as an argument and returns the value that occurs with the highest frequency. If multiple values appear with the same frequency, the `STATS_MODE` function arbitrarily chooses the first value and returns only that one value.

  - Add support for `DBMS_SQL` function/procedures `(DEFINE_COLUMN_LONG, COLUMN_VALUE_LONG and LAST_ERROR_POSITION)`

  - Support for function `to_timestamp_tz()`

  - Support for function/procedure specification inside package body

  - Support `FM` format in `to_number` function

  - Support for `utl_http.end_of_body` exception
    
    > This feature declares the `end_of_body` exception into `utl_http` package and throws the same from `read_line, read_text` and `read_raw` package procedures when no data is left in the response body.

  - `USING INDEX`
    
    > `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraint clauses now have a `CREATE INDEX` statement. This new syntax allows users to specify explicit index details like fillfactor, etc. Columns specified in the constraint and the columns specified in the index mustbe the same.
