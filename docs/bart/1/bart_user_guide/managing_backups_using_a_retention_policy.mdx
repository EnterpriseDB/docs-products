Over the course of time when using BART, the number of backups can grow
significantly. This ultimately leads to a large consumption of disk
space unless an administrator periodically performs the process of
deleting the oldest backups that are no longer needed. This process of
determining when a backup is old enough to be deleted and then actually
deleting such backups can be done and automated with the following basic
steps:

1.  Determine and set a retention policy in the BART configuration file.
    A *retention policy* is a rule that determines when a backup is
    considered obsolete. The retention policy can be applied globally to
    all servers, but each server can override the global retention
    policy with its own (see the configuration section of the *EDB
    Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for
    details).
2.  Use the `MANAGE` subcommand to categorize and manage backups
    according to the retention policy.

<!-- end list -->

  - 3\. Create a cron job to periodically run the `MANAGE` subcommand
    to  
    evaluate the backups and then list and/or delete the obsolete
    backups.
    
    There is a difference on how retention policy management applies to
    incremental backups as compared to full backups. See
