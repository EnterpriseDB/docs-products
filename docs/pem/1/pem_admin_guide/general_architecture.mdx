![*The Postgres Enterprise Manager general
architecture*](images/pem_architecture.png)

PEM is composed of three primary components:

**The PEM Server**

> The PEM server provides the functionality at the core of Postgres
> Enterprise Manager. The server is responsible for:

  - Performing administrative functions.
  - Processing information received from agents.
  - Maintaining information in its repository.

**The PEM Agent**

> The PEM agent is responsible for performing tasks on each managed
> machine and collecting statistics for the database server and
> operating system.

**The PEM Web Interface**

> Distributed with the PEM server, the PEM web interface allows you to
> connect to the server with your choice of browser to manage and
> monitor your Postgres servers.
